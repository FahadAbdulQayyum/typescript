// 23. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

let IAmFahad : string = "Fahad";

console.log(IAmFahad === "Fahad" ? "Yeah, I'm Fahad." : "No, I'm not Fahad.");

IAmFahad = "Aftab";

console.log(IAmFahad === "Fahad" ? "Yeah, I'm Fahad." : "No, I'm not Fahad.");

let age : number = 17;

console.log(age > 18 ? "You are eligible for CNIC." : "Sorry! You are not eligible for CNIC.");

age = 19;

console.log(age > 18 ? "You are eligible for CNIC." : "Sorry! You are not eligible for CNIC.");
